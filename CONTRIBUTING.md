# Contributing to Vampire: The Masquerade Character Tools Web Interface

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! At the moment, I'm focusing on building this tool as a solo effort to ensure that the initial development aligns with my vision. However, I absolutely welcome forks and encourage others to take this project in new directions if they’re inspired to do so.

### Current Status
For now, contributions in the form of direct pull requests are **not accepted**. This is simply because I'm aiming for a solid foundation before opening the doors to collaborative work. I will be open to external contributions in the future, and I’ll be sure to update this file and the project status when that time comes.

### Forking the Project
If you’re interested in using or expanding upon the codebase, feel free to **fork the repository** and develop it as you see fit. I’d love to see where you take it and how it evolves in your hands. Any insights or improvements that come from your forks could be helpful once I'm ready to open up the contribution process.

### Future Contributions
I am planning on welcoming contributions in the future. When that happens, there will be clear guidelines on:
- Setting up the development environment
- Coding conventions and standards
- Creating meaningful pull requests
- Filing issues and engaging in discussions

Until then, I appreciate your understanding and support. I’m excited to see where the community takes this once it’s ready for a broader collaboration!

Thanks again, and happy coding!
